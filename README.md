# Red-Black Tree Visualizer & Task Scheduler

**Interactive Java + React project** combining data structure visualization with practical task scheduling.  
Built with **Spring Boot (Java)** for the backend and **React.js** for the frontend, this project demonstrates the usage of algorithms, system design, and full-stack development.

## Features

### Data Structure Visualization
- Fully functional Red-Black Tree implementation in Java  
- Real-time insertion and balancing visualization through an interactive React frontend  
- Visual feedback for rotations, color flips, and rebalancing after insertions  
- RESTful API allows adding and viewing tree nodes dynamically  

### Task Scheduling Extension
- Each node can represent a task with a date, priority, or label  
- Tasks are stored and ordered using the Red-Black Tree for efficient retrieval and balancing
- Interactive scheduling UI with add/remove functionality  

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | React.js, Vite, Axios, D3.js (for tree rendering), TailwindCSS |
| **Backend** | Java, Spring Boot, Maven |
| **Data Structure** | Custom Red-Black Tree (`RedBlackTree.java`) |
| **API Format** | REST (JSON) |
| **Database** | In-memory (tree structure) |
